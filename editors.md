#Some things I learned about editors

###Things I learned about non graphical editors.
1. They are a lot less forgiving than graphical editors.
2. If you don't know what you are doing with a non graphical editor you will quickly make a mess of everything.
3. A cheat sheet is the most efficient way to get things rolling quickly in vi.
4. Non graphical editors seem stripped down at first but upon further inspection I found that they were very robust. It really is a matter of becoming familiar with the commands *(there are a lot of them)*.
5. vi feels like the product of decades of file editing in a terminal environment and is streamlined for efficiency.
###Things I learned about graphical editors.
1. Sublime Text is much easier to pick up and go with.
2. It functions much more like the gui word processors that I'm used to working with.
3. It auto completes and gives you colored syntax mapping which is totally awesome.
4. It feels a lot less rigid than vi.
